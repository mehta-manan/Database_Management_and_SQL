List of values
Mysql> … WHERE ColumnName IN (10, 20, 30);
Mysql> … WHHERE ColumnName = 10 OR ColumnName = 20 OR  ColumnName = 30;
Pattern matching
Mysql> SELECT * FROM TableName LIKE ‘%Name’;
					           ‘Name%’;
					           ‘%Name%’;
					           ‘Name__’;

Note: SELECT 2*3;		Output: 5
      SELECT 2+3 from Anything; (Anything is dummy table with 1 row and 1 column)

Column Alias
Mysql> SELECT ColumnName, 2*AnotherColumn AS ‘AliasColumn’ FROM TableName;

Group functions: These are the functions which works on the whole table or column at a time and gives only one output. There are five group functions and are divided into Single and Multi / Aggregate / Group.
Sum:     Mysql> SELECT sum(ColumnName) from TableName;
Minimum: Mysql> SELECT min(ColumnName) from TableName;
Maximum: Mysql> SELECT max(ColumnName) from TableName;
Average: Mysql> SELECT avg(ColumnName) from TableName;

Count(ColumnName) counts the total non-null values in a Column.
Count(*) counts the total number of records in a Column.

Group by: This clause is used to divide the table in small groups on the basis of column and gives output per group. Example:
Query to display department wise total number of employees:
Mysql> SELECT deptno, COUNT(*), max(sal) FROM emp GROUP BY deptno;
Query to display the average salary of only those departments where average salary is less than 20000:
Mysql> SELECT deptno, avg(sal) FROM emp GROUP BY deptno HAVING avg(sal) <20000.
